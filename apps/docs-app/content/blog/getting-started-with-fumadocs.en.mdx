## Introduction

[Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev) is a powerful documentation framework for Next.js. In this post, we'll share our experience setting up and customizing Fumadocs for our project.

### Why Fumadocs?

We chose Fumadocs for several reasons:

1. **Built for Next.js**: Native integration with the App Router
2. **MDX Support**: Write documentation with React components
3. **Internationalization**: Built-in i18n support for multiple languages
4. **Search**: Integrated search functionality out of the box
5. **Theming**: Customizable UI that matches our brand

### Key Features We Use

#### MDX Content

Fumadocs uses MDX, which allows us to embed React components directly in our documentation:

```tsx
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout title="Note">
  This is an important callout!
</Callout>
```

#### Internationalization

Our documentation supports both English and Chinese, making it accessible to a wider audience.

#### Static Export

We can generate a fully static site, perfect for hosting on any CDN.

### Conclusion

Fumadocs has been an excellent choice for our documentation needs. Its flexibility and feature set make it ideal for projects of any size.

If you're looking to build documentation for your Next.js project, we highly recommend giving Fumadocs a try!
